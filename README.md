There are two simulations of CV scans using a microkinetic model for surface occupation. 

1. Microkinetic model for electrochemical CO stripping.

Adapts analyses in
   Koper, M. T. M.; Jansen, A. P. J.; van Santen, R. A.; Lukkien, J. J.; Hilbers, P. A. J. Monte Carlo Simulations of a Simple Model for the Electrocatalytic CO Oxidation on Platinum. [J. Chem. Phys. 1998, 109, 6051–6062](http://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.477230).

The paper is one of a very few examples of which I am aware of applying a stochastic analysis to electrochemistry: in it, a mean field model is compared to a lattice Monte Carlo simulation for a model reaction, CO stripping from Pt. In this notebook, the mean field model is coded. 

2. Optimum binding energies for multi-electron transfer electrocatalyis

Adapts analyses in
    Ooka, H.; Nakamura, R. Shift of the Optimum Binding Energy at Higher Rates of Catalysis. [J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2019, 6706–6713](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.9b01796).

The optimum H binding energy is calculated for different assumptions for the relative rates of the Heyvorsky and Volmer steps of the electrochemical hydrogen oxidation reaction. 

To the analyses in the paper, steady state and transient calculations of the surface coverages and current densities are added.
